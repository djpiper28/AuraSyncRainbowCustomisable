# AuraSyncRainbowCustomisable
Compile it yourself and play with the code as it has a corrective piece of code for my phanteks rgb strip is rather slow. Just use vs community 2017 and load the file that is ConsoleApplication1.sln or something.

To change the speed:
  Either change the value in
    ```sleep(50);``` 
    to be smaller, 
  or the value in 
    ```deg+=1;``` 
    to be bigger.
    
  I would say use:
      ```Sleep(40);```
    and
      ```deg+=5;111
